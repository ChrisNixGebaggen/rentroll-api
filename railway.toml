## Railway configuration for the Rent Roll API
#
# This file tells Railway how to build and deploy the Python server.
# It specifies the build system (Nixpacks) and defines a health check
# for the deployment to ensure the service is running. The restart
# policy ensures the service is restarted on failure.

[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"  # Use Nixpacks to automatically detect and build dependencies

[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/api/health"        # Endpoint used by Railway to check if the app is healthy
healthcheckTimeout = 300               # Timeout for the health check in seconds
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"       # Restart the service if it fails
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10           # Maximum number of restart attempts
